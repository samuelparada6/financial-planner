# financial-planner
A side project to design a Financial Planner available for users wishing to create a budget that is easy to use and customizable for their own personal use.

## Motivation
I want to work on this project to provide a practical budgetting application for myself as a Chi Alpha Missionary that will allow me to remain organized according to the nuances of spending as an XA Missionary. Also, I want to keep practicing and honing my skills I learned during Undergrad and years prior.
